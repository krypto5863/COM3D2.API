#### COM3D2 API
API plugins can use to do stuff. Currently only has an API for adding buttons to the SystemShortcut (gear icon) menu, a way to set game version limits, add a new category button and add a controller to a maid you can use to dynamically work on said maid and save/load data specific to them.
